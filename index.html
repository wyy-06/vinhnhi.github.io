    <h1>Hi, I'm Vinh Nhi</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my personal website! 
      Here, you’ll find a brief introduction about me, my background, skills, and hobbies. This project is part of my Assignment 2 for my Computer Science class with Thầy Đăng, but I have put a lot of effort into making it personal and meaningful. ^^</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>I am Vinh Nhi, cohort 28 and I am a second year student at Fulbright University. 
      My major is Art and Media because I am interested in Filming and I want to do more research about art articles. 
      I am passionate about designing creative stuff, sketching, travelling, photographing and exploring new ideas that take me out of my comfort zone.
     One of my biggest inspirations is Khoai Lang Thang. His videos and mindset have deeply inspired me in my journey of defining myself. 
      I really love traveling, just like him. The way he faces challenges and embraces new experiences has truly changed my mindset and helped me see life in a more positive and meaningful way.
